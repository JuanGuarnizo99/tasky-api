# tasky-api
This repo holds the code for the backend side of my todo list app called Tasky.
The Tasky app is a todolist app tha lets you manage your hectic life.  
You can register, login, add, edit, and delete tasks.
## Technologies used
In this project I used node.js and express to build the backend app.  
I used postgreSQL to manage the database.  
I used render.com to manage the database and deploy both my backend and my frontend app.  
To use this app yourself you can go to https://tasky-app.onrender.com  
## About me
At the time of developing this full stack project (go to https://github.com/JuanGuarnizo99/tasky to see the front end app code)  
I am a computer science student interested in a career as a software backend engineer.  
This is my very first project, and even though front end development is not my passion I had a fun time learning about it.
